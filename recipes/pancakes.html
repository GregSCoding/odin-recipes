        <h4>Ingridients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/3 teaspoon salt/li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Recipe:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In medium bowl, beat egg with wire whisk until fluffy. Stir in remaining ingredients just until flour is moistened (batter will be slightly lumpy);
                 do not overmix or pancakes will be tough. For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk.</li>
            <li>Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375Â°F).(To test griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water.
                If bubbles jump around, heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray before heating).</li>
            <li> For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges.
                 Turn; cook other side until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</li>
        </ol>
